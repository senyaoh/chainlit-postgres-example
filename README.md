## Development
To run the application locally, make sure you have set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` or set it in the `docker-compose` file, then simply run:
```
docker compose up --build
```
This starts the `postgres` container, loads the `Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset` into the database, and starts the Chatbot application container. You could visit the chatbot at
